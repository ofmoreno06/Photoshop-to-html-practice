# Photoshop to html practice

This excercise was part of a test for a job offer. At that time I was just learning but I did my best googling asking and practicing. I did not get that particular job but I learned a lot doing this :)

## The mission

Someone sent some layouts to me in image format and my task is convert the layout to code.  

layout1:   
<img src="https://github.com/ofmoreno06/Photoshop-to-html-practice/blob/master/layout/pjamas1.png?raw=true" 
alt="Layout1" width="500/></a>

layout2:   
<img src="https://github.com/ofmoreno06/Photoshop-to-html-practice/blob/master/layout/pjamas2.png?raw=true" 
alt="Layout2" width="500/></a>
