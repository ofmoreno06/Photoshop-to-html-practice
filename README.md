# Photoshop to html practice

This excercise was part of a test for applying to a job. At that time I was just learning but I did my best googling asking and practicing. I did not get that particular job but I learned a lot doing this :)

## The mission

Someone sent to me some layouts in image format and my task is convert the layouts to code.  
You can checkout the final result of the exercise in [this link!](https://ofmorenor.github.io/Photoshop-to-html-practice/index.html)
